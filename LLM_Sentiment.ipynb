I just drove past Burwood Rd during my late night Maccas run and saw him standing there, all by himself.\\n\\nPoor lad! Hope he gets the help he needs.\\n\\nThat said, I have seen plenty of people (and a good number at that) hesitate before taking these stairs and got stuck in the same situation a few times after ending up taking different routes or giving in, but the determination of this bloke to not yield is almost inspirational.\\n\\nI think the fact that he is still alive and kicking (although not going anywhere) possibly point to the theory that he has a secret backer that has been feeding him food this whole time. Who could it be?\\n\\nThat I think is a good question, but I do not know the answer, as with many great questions in life. Like what if Bill Clinton\\'s name is indeed Bill and not a nickname for William? Well, a history class at Swinburne might teach you that, but I haven\\'t taken the course, so who am I to answer, I\\'ll leave that open ended.\\n\\nBut I know that, whatever this guy stranded at the bottom of the stairs willing to stand up to what he believe in will inspire many generations to come, almost the same way as when Plato did not yield before the Athenian court. He stays true to his virtue and will not change in the face of the adversity from the adherers of the many! Truly a tale for all times. He is sacrificing so much - too much! - even his wealth - like the ancient Plato - just to live true to what he believes is right and just.\\n\\nThis guy may have developed himself a ritual - dare I say a complex philosophical system on his attachment to these stairs, that he finds himself in such a moral dilemma when it takes on a new aesthetics and in turn embodies a different value system contradictory to his own and to what he believes to be universal at least to his class.\\n\\nAnd instead of backing away and abandoning his post like so many others, he decided to stay where he was and engage in an almost dialectical battle with the stairs as an image - a projection - a simulacra of the modern Australian and wider global Political Economic landscape - that he - without a doubt - has learned from all the business classes at Swinburne University where it is confirmed that he is enrolled in given his prior rarely spoken words on Google Reviews.\\n\\nNevertheless, he needs help, and might actually be getting the help that he needs, are they his disciples?

In terms of location, it’s conveniently situated next to Glenferrie Station and shopping strip, perfect for quick coffee breaks. There are also plenty of shops on campus and lots of cozy spots to grab something to eat between classes.\\n\\nThe university hosts a variety of events during the semester, with many clubs setting up stalls all over campus. They offer comedy nights, karaoke at The Junction, guest speakers, and insightful seminars. Although they do a good job of concealing the numerous international arms trade deals they’re involved in, you can find links to some of this research on campus. It’s world-class research, and if it weren’t contributing to so much destruction, I’d be quite impressed.\\n\\nThe facilities are excellent, with plenty of well-maintained toilets and buildings cared for by staff and students. Friendly staff are always available to help you navigate the grounds, and the library is a one-stop shop for any information you might need. If you’re a student or looking for a place to study, the inner-city campus is highly accessible, with a nice blend of greenery throughout the buildings that brings the campus to life.', \"My journey in Melbourne started here so this place will always have a special place in my heart.\\n\\nI will never forget that wide-eyed me who couldn't believe that I was a part of such a renowned institution. Although they do put you under a lot of pressure, eventually you learn to manage it all.\\n\\nI miss the freebies and all the exciting events they had back in the day.\", 'Extremely Disappointed - A Complete Waste of Time and Money\\n\\nI enrolled in an online Community Service course at Swinburne University, expecting a decent learning experience and some level of support, especially since I was paying a significant amount of money. What I received was a complete disappointment.\\n\\nFirst off, student resources were practically nonexistent. I tried reaching out for assistance multiple times, whether it was for study-related queries or any support, but there was barely anyone available to help. If you’re hoping for some sort of meaningful interaction with staff or access to learning resources, don’t count on it.\\n\\nAfter just one month into the course, I realized this was a complete waste of time and decided to cancel. When I requested a refund or at least a partial refund, given the minimal support and lack of actual teaching, I was charged 50% of the tuition despite having done almost no work due to the lack of guidance. Their response? \"No mercy\" — they still charged me and offered no flexibility, even citing \"economic reasons\" as justification.\\n\\nAt this point, I started to feel like I had been completely misled. I could have taken this course at TAFE for a much lower cost and much better support, but I chose Swinburne because they promised personalized support and resources. I now realize this was a huge mistake. They’re just another for-profit institution with no genuine care for students.\\n\\nIf you\\'re thinking about enrolling at Swinburne, my advice is to look elsewhere. Find a school that actually cares about its students and provides real support — unlike Swinburne, which only cares about collecting tuition fees and leaving you high and dry when you need help.\\n\\nSave your time, energy, and money — choose a better school.', 'Visited today and must say was amazed at how big the university was. I love that they offer all day parking ($10) all within a short stroll of the buildings and have multiple cafes onsite. The facilities were clean and staff so lovely. So impressed. The train station is also super close which saves a lot of money on parking for students. Plenty of off site places to eat aswell.', \"For the past 6 months at Swinburne University it's a good university. They'd progressed so much from the rubbish club payments into a more organised, less complex way. It's becoming into a prestigious University. The new modern late labs. LAS is more visible which is located in the middle of the campus. My experience at Swinburne University socially is really. Swinburne helped me to become independent. The Teachers I have during the year are good. My advice is to go to the TD Café. TAFE here is underrated. The only cons are public transport takes 2 hours by train for folks living in the northern and western suburbs because they are no direct transportation and Women's bathrooms should supply free pads and tampons. The crimson wave can come in unexpected times like during the middle of a class. Swinburne is only for students who have the initiative to come to most classes otherwise the experience will be totally different.\", \"Someone seems stuck at the bottom of these atrium stairs they havent moved since Monday. I've already encountered them in the same spot three times this week walking across the area. Could someone go check on them?\", 'Swinburne University has a great civil engineering course. The subjects are developed with assistance from industry making them all very relevant. In addition to their helpful teaching staff which often go out of their way to assist students with their issues makes for a great university. I would highly recommend Swinburne. I should also mention that the photos taken are of the Hawthorn campus.', 'AN ODE TO THE STAIRS GUY\\n\\nTo start, and to begin with a little story, prayers to that guy at the bottom of the stairs at Swinburne.
